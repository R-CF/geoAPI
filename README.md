<!-- badges: start -->

<!-- badges: end -->

The geoAPI package is an implementation in native R code of the OGC Java
geoAPI reference implementation of the standard “Referencing by
coordinate”.

This is currently in the very early stages of development and not really
useful for anything but some testing.

## Installation

You can install the development version of geoAPI from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("R-CF/geoAPI")
```
