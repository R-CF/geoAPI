# geoAPI

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The geoAPI package is an implementation in native R code of the OGC Java geoAPI reference implementation of the standard "Referencing by coordinate".

This is currently in the very early stages of development and not really useful for anything but some testing.

## Installation

You can install the development version of geoAPI from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("R-CF/geoAPI")
```
